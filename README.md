# Ecommerce-company-strategy
This project is a part of the Python fpr data science and machine learning bootcamp. 

#### Project Summary 
An Ecommerce company based in New York City sells clothing online, but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The __goal__ of the project is to help the company decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website, by using linear regression. 

#### Conclusion
'time on website' feature does not have a sizable effect on money spent by customers, so the company can save money by non focusing on improving their website. On the other hand, 'time on app' is actually very effective, a minute more on the app associates to $38.5 increase in spending, in case no other features have changed. 

Finally, 'length of membership' is the feature with the highest correlation to spending, so the company should make sure to take care of its old customers in order to increase sales. Also it is worth mentioning that the company can focus its efforts on its website, in order to increase its website visitors spending.
